# NoExploits

Hi, I noticed there has been quite a bit of clientside mod abuse recently so I decided to create some stuff to prevent it. Currently this prevents:

- [x] Mods that increase the Statue of Power Max Rank for Pals past 10. These mods work without the server having the mod which lets the clients have impossible to achieve stats on any Pal.

## Installation

1. Download the latest experimental version of UE4SS [here](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases/download/experimental/UE4SS_v3.0.1-137-g6867a08.zip) or go to the experimental releases and find the .zip with `UE4SS_v3.0.1-137-g6867a08` in the name.

2. Extract UE4SS into the Win64 folder of your server

3. Download the [latest release of the mod](https://github.com/Okaetsu/NoExploits/releases)

4. Extract the mod folder that's inside the zip into Pal\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods folder of your server

5. Done! This is purely a server-side mod, so clients won't need it.
